## Problems for AlgoLab course at ETH Zurich. Fall 2019 

You might find this of no use, but, for students at ETH, it might be interesting!

Week 9
1. Satellites - MinCut
2. Algocoon - MinCost MaxFlow
3. Canteen - MinCost MaxFlow with Nonnegative weights
  <br>
  Trick: Add large additive weight & compensate later.
  </br>
  <br>
  Obs: For n aprox 1000, use successive_shortest_path_nonnegative_weights, NOT cycle_canceling.
